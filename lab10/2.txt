setImmediate and process.nextTick are two functions which allows us to control the order
of execution of our code in the event loop. Both of these functions schedule our callback
handlers in the event queue. But they are executed at different phases of the event loop.
The differences between setImmediate and process.nextTick as follow
1.  setTimeout is processed in the Check handlers phase, while process. nextTick is processed at
    the event loop and between each phase of the event loop.
2.  on any given context process.nextTick has higher priority over setImmediate.
3.  if process.nextTick is called in a given phase, all the callbacks passed to process.nextTick
    will be resolved before the event loop continues.This will block the event loop and create I/of
    Starvation if process.nextTick is called recursively.
4.  unlike process.nextTick, recursive calls to setImmediate won't block the event loop, because every
    recursive call is executed only on the next event loop iteration.
