                        in a mission on the distant world of Pandora. There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead
                        Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid "Na'vi" in order to mine for
                        the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal
                        surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers knowledge, of the Indigenous Race and their
                        Culture, for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while
                        simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an "avatar" identity.
                        While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful
                        alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics,
                        forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora.

                    <p>
                        Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing
                        valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at
                        its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new
                        world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him
                        everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job
                        could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of
                        the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is
                        not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no
                        amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems
                        to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.
